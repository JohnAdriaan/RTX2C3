/// \brief A Queue that can be accessed atomically.
///
/// ## Description:
///   This Queue is designed to be used between the main thread and an ISR. That is,
/// it is NOT designed for use between multiple threads. Thus, an `Add()` could be
/// interrupted by `Remove()`s, or vice versa, but not itself.
///
///   With many Queue implementations, the consumers de-queue the next item and then
/// use it. This single-consumer implementation prefers if the next item remains on
/// the queue while it is being used, and then de-queued when finished.
///
///   This has the decided advantage that `Add()` can advise whether there's already
/// something still on the Queue - so no need to e.g. initiate transmission.
///
/// ## Implementation:
///   Note that the `next` pointer within `NODE` needs to be passed in to the
/// constructor. It's probably called "next", so that is the default parameter.
/// If it is called something else, pass that in instead - and then it doesn't even
/// matter if `NODE` doesn't have a member called "next"!
///
///   Also note that `Add()` needs to know that the previous `last` is still at the
/// end of the Queue. _This_ Queue. Just having `nullptr` means that it might be at
/// the end of a _different_ Queue, thus it'd still get modified. To prevent that,
/// each Queue has its own, unique, end-of-queue marker called `null`, which, like
/// `nullptr`, never gets dereferenced. How is it unique? It's `this`!
/// <br />And for reference: if `next` is indeed `nullptr`, it's not on _any_ Queue.
